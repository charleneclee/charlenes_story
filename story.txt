Once upon a time, there was a wolf named Lobo. He didn't have very many friends, because he couldn't howl loudly at the moon. He couldn't help it. Every time he wanted to howl at the moon, he felt nervous and it didn't work out well. Lobo didn't like this. He wanted things to change. So he decided to make a model of the moon to practice howling at.
