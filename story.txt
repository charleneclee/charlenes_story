Once upon a time, there was a wolf named Lobo. He didn't have very many friends, because he couldn't howl loudly at the moon. He couldn't help it. Every time he wanted to howl at the moon, he felt nervous and it didn't work out well. Lobo didn't like this. He wanted things to change. So he decided to make a model of the moon to practice howling at. First, he howled at home in his room. Then, he went out, deep into the forest, and howled at the moon cutout during the day. Finally, he practiced at night. At the next full moon, the other wolves all rolled their eyes at Lobo. When it was time to howl, Lobo did it! And he was so happy and proud of himself. Lobo learned that determination and hard work pay off, and practice makes perfect!

Lobo had a sister that knew how to howl the whole time; her name was Loba. Lobo could have asked his sister for help, but he was too shy. He could have avoid going out into the the forest, and used the travel time to eat ice cream instead.
